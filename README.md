# DEMO_web_multipurpose_app_ORM_modules
The purpose ot this app is just to show the power ot Python language as backend "engine" of web application.
I am not pretending that this code is complete nor structured perfectly correctly, 
the idea is to show my level of understanding the relations between the technologies used in this project and my ability to use them.
